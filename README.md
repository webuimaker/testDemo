***Disclaimer:*** *Remember there is no such thing as absolute security. Our objective is to connect you with the leading privacy tools available and start you down the path of better security and privacy. This training comes with no guarantees. Always do your own independent research.*

**Data**

In Module 1, we’ve unpacked the common examples of what intermediaries consider ‘your data.’ i.e. the personal information you willingly disclose – your name, email address, as well as things you post on social platforms, emails you send, photos you share, queries you search for, text messages you send and so on. In short, anything you actively upload or enter. Most people consider this first type of data to be the most important to preserve when it comes to their online privacy.

**Metadata**

However, it is metadata – this second, lesser considered type of data - that we leave behind us as we navigate through cyber space – that we must also take active steps to protect if we are serious about our online privacy. This ‘metadata’, or ‘about you’, data is highly valuable to corporate intermediaries and other entities who seek to profit from, restrict or predict your activities.

‘Metadata’ is an amalgamation of data that includes patterns, insights or other user behavior information that intermediaries gather in the course of your use of their services.

However, Facebook not only collects and stores this given information you’ve provided them (your data), but also collects and stores the **metadata** surrounding this post: the date & time of posting, and all the information constantly leaking from your device, including but not limited to your [Geo-location](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotagging), [IP Address](https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-actions-and-decisions/research/explore-privacy-research/2013/ip_201305/), [Digital Fingerprint](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-beginners-guide-to-online-privacy-7149b33c4a3e) (also check out [https://amiunique.org](https://amiunique.org/) ), [MAC address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address) and finally, [Linking](http://www.connectsafely.org/linking-offline-and-online-behavior-is-creepy-despite-privacy-protections/).

**But how do “they” get my metadata?**

Precise locations are leaked by devices, even if location services are turned off, even if you do not have a SIM card and even if you do not have any apps installed. Google & Co are known to map IP addresses, wifi connection points and mobile towers, which allow them to know where a device is connecting or attempting to connect all without using the phone’s location service. Read it straight from [Apple’s privacy policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/): “Where available, location-based services may use GPS, Bluetooth, and your IP Address, along with crowd-sourced Wi-Fi hotspot and cell tower locations, and other technologies to determine your devices’ approximate location.”

Android phones ship with barometric devices that use air pressure which may be used to calculate where a user may be located in a multi-story building.

By owning and carrying a smart device with you, it is important to understand that data about you is constantly being broadcasted to the device manufacturer, the operating system developer and the developers of any apps you have installed.

To give you a sense of how much data is being broadcast about you, it is worth reading this article which illustrates a recent investigation by Oracle into Google where it was discovered that as much as Gigabyte of user data per month was being harvested the users of Googles Android devices!

In Modules 3-8, we’ll be discussing the exact steps you can take to minimize the collection of your metadata. The purpose of this lesson is to highlight that both of these types of data are being collected about you when you operate online.

**Key Questions:**

1. What are the two types of information that constitute your digital footprint?
2. Provide two examples of each.

**Lesson 3 – Tracking  (Cookies, Link Tracking and Data Aggregation)**

Tracking is one of the most important concepts to understand with when it comes to online privacy.

In the context of this training, tracking is defined as the use of various techniques to record users and their online behavior.

For the purposes of this training, we will look at Cookies, Link Tracking and Data Aggregation.

*Part 1 – Cookies*

One website we visited states:

“A cookie isn't just a delicious snack. A cookie is also a small text file stored by websites and other applications _on your device_. This helps a website or app to remember useful information about you.”
